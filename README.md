## 📖 Introduction

**reBot-DevArm (reBot Arm B601 DM and reBot Arm B601 RS)** is a robotic arm project dedicated to lowering the barrier to learning Embodied AI. We focus on **"True Open Source"** — not just the code, we unreservedly open source everything:
- 🦾 **Two versions of the robotic arm**：We will provide all open-source files for two versions of the robotic arm with the same appearance: **Robostride** and **Damiao**.
- 🛠️ **Hardware Blueprints**: Source files for sheet metal parts and 3D printed parts.
- 🔩 **BOM List**: Detailed down to the specifications and purchase links for every single screw.
- 💻 **Software & Algorithms**: Python SDK, ROS1/2, Isaac Sim, LeRobot, etc.

## Get Your Own reBot Arm
